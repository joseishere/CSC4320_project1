          1. For the marination, take a bowl and mix chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, curd and salt together. This marination step is very important and will give this chicken recipe real flavour. 
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Now, wash the chicken in cold running water and chop it. Once it is done, add the chicken pieces in the above mixture and marinate them. Once the chicken pieces are well coated, keep them aside for 4-6 hours so that flavours are well absorbed.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Now, take a deep-bottomed pan and heat oil in it over moderate flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, carefully put the marinated chicken pieces in the oil and shallow fry them till cooked or golden from both the sides.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Now, remove and cook the chicken pieces in a separate pan without oil over low flame. This step will make the chicken more crispy. Once done, add the green chillies, curry leaves and ketchup. Mix well till the chicken pieces are well coated and continue to cook over medium heat for 5-6 minutes. Transfer the dish in a serving bowl and garnish it with chopped spring onions. Chicken 65 is ready to serve.
